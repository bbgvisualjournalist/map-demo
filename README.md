### Resources ###

### Spreadsheet best practices ###

* Keep the column labels simple and consistent. I generally keep my labels lowercase or camelCase without spaces (and no special characters).
* Make sure that individual columns of data are consistently formatted, so that columns of coordinates (or dates) are all formatted the same way (within the column).
